CloudQuery DigitalOcean Provider ![BuildStatus](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/cloudquery/cq-provider-aws/test?style=flat-square) ![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/cloudquery/cloudquery?style=flat-square)
==================================

This [CloudQuery](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery)
provider transforms DigitalOcean resource to relational and graph databases.

## What is CloudQuery

CloudQuery pulls, normalize, expose and monitor your cloud infrastructure and SaaS apps as SQL.
This abstracts various scattered APIs enabling you to define security,governance,cost and compliance policies with SQL.

cloudquery can be easily extended to more resources and SaaS providers (open an [Issue](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery/issues)).

Think about cloudquery as a compliance-as-code tool inspired by tools like [osquery](https://github.com/osquery/osquery)
and [terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform).
